# Stock-Analysis
This Python script analyzes stock data for a list of predefined tickers. It calculates key Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) and identifies stocks that meet specific conditions, such as being within a certain range of their 150-day SMA or showing "Golden Cross" or "Red Cross" patterns. The results are output in a tabular format.
